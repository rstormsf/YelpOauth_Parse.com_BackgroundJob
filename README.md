# YelpOauth_Parse.com_BackgroundJob
Query Yelp API to save in Parse.com backend


Example of how you can make oauth with 3rd party like Yelp.com on Parse.com platform via Background Job and then saving to Backend object

If you want to make a call to another service, just modify `yelp.js` file

`sha1.js` and `oauth.js` are just libraries that are not available in Parse.com modules via `require`
